## 🚀 To See the Changes

### Option 1: If Running Development Server

If you have `npm start` running:

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl + C)
2. **Restart it**:
   ```bash
   cd c:\CBT\frontend
   npm start
   ```
3. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + F5 for hard refresh)

### Option 2: If Deployed/Production

The built files are in `c:\CBT\frontend\build\`

**For Firebase Hosting:**
```bash
cd c:\CBT\frontend
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**For Netlify:**
- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Drag and drop the `build` folder
- Or use Netlify CLI:
  ```bash
  cd c:\CBT\frontend
  netlify deploy --prod --dir=build
  ```

**For Manual Deployment:**
Copy all files from `c:\CBT\frontend\build\` to your web server

### Option 3: Test Locally with Static Server

```bash
cd c:\CBT\frontend
npx serve -s build
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## 🧪 Testing the Filters

### Students Tab
1. Go to Students Management
2. You should see filters at the top:
   - **Department** dropdown
   - **Level** dropdown  
   - **Student ID** search box
   - **Clear Filters** button
3. Try filtering by department or level
4. Search for a student ID
5. Counter shows "Showing X of Y students"

### Results Tab
1. Go to Results Management
2. You should see two rows of filters:
   - **Row 1**: Exam, Student, Department
   - **Row 2**: Level, Student ID, Clear All Filters
3. Try combining multiple filters
4. Counter shows "Showing X of Y results"

## ✅ What to Expect

### Filter Behavior
- All filters work together (AND logic)
- Selecting Department shows only students from that department
- Selecting Level shows only students at that level
- Student ID search does partial matching
- Clear button resets all filters
- Selected items clear when changing filters

### Results Tab Special Note
Results are filtered based on the **student's** department and level, so:
- Only results from students in the selected department will show
- Only results from students at the selected level will show
